# Web-Scraping-Using-BeautifulSoup

DESCRIPTION:

This is a program that scrapes Weather Conditions from https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=34.0536&lon=-118.2455#.XyFbdJ4zaM8. It collects all the relevant attributes of the given City in USA. A seven day predicted forecast is scraped and put together as a table. Furthur, using pandas it converts it into a .csv file that the output/result of the whole program can be then viewed in an excel sheet. 

TOOLS USED:

Python: It is a widely used user friendly, high level programming language. Along with code readability, it makes programming easy by its compactness. It has by far the easiest syntax and it is majorly used in machine learning and data science practices.

Pandas: Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables. In this program it was used in converting the data collected to a .csv file.

BeautifulSoup: Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

Requests:The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).

CONCLUSION:

By running this code one can collect the predicted weather conditions in an excel sheet.
